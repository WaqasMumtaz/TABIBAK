    target of Rs. 4,691 billion by Rs. 54 billion. Continuing this momentum in the current
    financial year was major challenge. However, FBR not only maintained the momentum, but
    produced even better performance during the first half of FY2022. This is evident from the
    revenue collection made during the period. The target for the July-December 2021 was
    exceeded by 11 percent or Rs. 287 Billion in absolute terms. Another significant aspect is that
    for the first time, the annual target has been achieved to the extent of 50.1 percent against the
    average of 46 percent six monthly achievement in the previous years. All the taxes except
    FED have achieved their respective targets`,

    detail: `During current FY2022 July-December period, the share of domestic taxes has declined to
    47.9% as compared to 55.7% during the previous FY (Table 6 & Graph 4). There are a
    number of reasons for this. In case of crude oil, the incidence of taxation has shifted from
    domestic (ex-refinery) to import stage. This has contributed heavily in reducing the share of
    domestic sales tax. Second, the increase in international price of such essential items as
    edible has increased their overall import value, which has also resulted in higher sales tax at
    import stage. Import of edible oil in value terms increased from Rs.196.2 billion to Rs.329.1
    billion or 67.8%, in the first of half of CFY as compared to H1 PFY. Third, due to increased
    economic activity in sectors like textile and agriculture, imports of cotton and fertilizers have
    recorded significant increase. For instance, import of cotton has jumped in terms of quantity
    and value by 19.2% and 64.2% respectively.`,

Analysis of Components of Income Tax
Collection on Demand (CoD) and Advance Tax / Payments with Returns:
Collection on demand as a whole and itâ€™s both components witness decline during the first
half of the CFY. This was primarily because of the FBR policy of providing maximum
facilitation to the business community and furnishing conducive business environment for
greater economic growth. The collection from current demand declined by 62.5% and arrear
demand by 31.9% (Table 7). Major part of income tax comes from withholding taxes,
whereas CoD shares around 2%.
